      Welcome, gorgeous. I am so glad your path has led you here to intersect with mine. Do you realize how much choice
      you get in the matter of your mental, emotional, and physical health? Lifestyle choices we make everyday not only
      affect our developing babies, they have the potential to play a major role in our labor, postpartum healing (both
      physically and mentally), and transition into and through motherhood.

      I don’t believe in a perfect pregnancy.
      Our hormones will turn on us, our ever-changing bodies will give us aches that keep us readjusting every five
      minutes, and we may even gain our tiger stripes (aka stretch marks). But, uncontrollable factors aside...

      I do believe an empowered woman can make conscious choices that will maximize her physical, mental, and social
      health.

      When she aligns with and acts upon her inner truths, then contentment, wholeness, and joy will radiate out of her
      with such intensity that the only word to describe it is GLOW. What would it mean to you to wake up every day and
      feel joy and vitality so strongly that its infectious to those around us?

      Meaningful relationships, a fulfilling career, a solid spiritual practice, enjoyable physical activity, and
      delicious, nutrient-dense food all feed us, and in turn, nourish our growing babes. That glowing radiance comes
      when we are being nourished socially, emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually.

      During my studies in kinesiology, I learned the intricacies of our bodies’ reactions to exercise, as well as the
      endless physiological benefits to our long term longevity. At the same time, I was earning my psychology minor
      which taught me the neurological connections we form with emotion, society, bonding, pleasure, and more. Weaving
      this all together, along with my experience as a mama of two littles, I coach that overall health, vitality, and
      happiness comes when we are being fed the BEST forms of nourishment both on and off the plate.

      Do you feel like you are in control of your
      own health, happiness, and glow?

      Do you feel truly nourished in your body, mind, and soul? I support and empower mothers to discover how the
      slightest shifts in your life can have profound long term effects on your health, happiness, and your baby. Mama,
      let’s map out your personal blueprint to a life of health, joy, and that ever sought after “glow”.
